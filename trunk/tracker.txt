Progress bar:
  -  Cancelable progressbar
  -  Memory usage bound
  -  Memory usage indicator
  -  Modal progress bar
  -  Rework executor model to show several running tasks' progress
  -  Disable actions while action is being completed
  -  Document write cookie to protect from starting several actions at a time
  -  document action cookie to prevent more than one action running on one document
  -  Use IProgressIndicator everywhere
  -  Show percentage on progress bar control


History:
  -  Remember history of actions
  -  Entropy changes log
  -  steps counter


Macros:
  -  Macros support


System function dialog:
  -  System Functions parser
  -  system function dialog: use IoC
  -  system function dialog: system parameters => solver => solver parameters
  -  system function default parameters
  -  system function default system space
  -  system function dialog: symmetric space mode
  -  support double with . or ,

Drawer:
  -  Embed drawer program from Nikita?
  -  Use drawer program from Nikita?
  -  allow to move 3d pictures
  -  allow to zoom pictures
  -  show points with squares
  -  export points files: , or . or matcad or maple etc

Misc:
  -  TeamCity
  -  Submit exception form
  -  Submit exception service online

Entropy:
  -  entropy computation actions (matrix)
  -  include eigen entropy
  -  create eigen options
  -  compute entropy on every component (depends on per-components feature)
  -  combinatorics method -> separate

Feature:
  -  segment iterator?
  -  components chooser
  -  components legend
  -  joined wizards
  -  Mnemonics manager	
  -  unsimmentric construction support
  -  subdivision selector
  -  repeat construction mode
  -  several invariant measures for one document

Bugs:
  -  do not show entropy on invariant measure picture
  -  not responding after focus lost
  -  embedded IE used to flickr
  -  format cells with spaces
  -  entropy is zero for loop searcher

Internal:
  -  support ConstraintAttribute hierarchy
  -  support DefaultValueAttribute
  -  strange entropy modes manual description
  -  remember selected construction method
  -  use box method by default
  -  drop ICodeCompiler singleton

Completed:
  x  no more predefined systems
  x  align progress bar to buttom
  x  Wizard Form presenter
  x  Wizard and Result interface  
  x  recompute invcariant measure
  x  compute measure depends on context-available
  -  Trop 'toolStripStatusLabel1' text
  -  Do not show Combinatorics
  -  No document banner
  -  Activate form on start
  -  Support adaptive method
  -  JVR action options control title broken.
  -  Progress bar may be started without any task inside
  -  Progress bar should use meaningful description for actions
  -  Bug fix progress bar
